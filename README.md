### **Stopping-Time Universality in Signaling-Safe Objective Collapse**
[Paper Link: IPRT/Collapse-Universality](cite: 1)
* [cite_start]This paper proves a classification theorem for objective-collapse theories, demonstrating that signaling-safe "physical collapse" is isomorphic to information updating within a consistent instrument framework[cite: 8, 9].
* [cite_start]Any model that is sharp in single runs and signaling-safe in ensembles (linear CPTP evolution) is mathematically equivalent to conditioning on a quantum instrument[cite: 8, 28].
* [cite_start]When collapse is triggered by a threshold in a record-adapted sharpness statistic, collapse-time laws are restricted to first-passage families[cite: 10, 61].
* [cite_start]In the canonical drift-diffusion limit, the collapse-time statistics follow the Inverse-Gaussian (Wald) distribution[cite: 11, 68].

* **Mathematical Identity:**
[cite_start]$$f_{\tau}(t) = \frac{y_{*}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi t^{3}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y_{*} - \nu t)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}t}\right)$$ [cite: 70]

### **Algebraic Consistency of Relativistic Field Theories**
[Paper Link: IPRT/Relativistic-Field-CST](cite: 167)
* [cite_start]This research extends the Causality-Stability Tester (CST) framework to FLRW spacetime, providing a dynamical diagnostic for early-Universe field theories[cite: 173, 182].
* [cite_start]It introduces **Gate G7 (Adiabatic Stability)**, which ensures that time-dependent frequencies vary slowly enough to prevent explosive particle creation[cite: 173, 201].
* [cite_start]An exact Horndeski/DHOST inflationary attractor is constructed that satisfies all consistency gates, including ghost-freedom and hyperbolicity[cite: 174, 185].
* [cite_start]The model derives tensor speed corrections strictly constrained by LIGO/Virgo observations to within $|c_{T}-1|\le10^{-15}$[cite: 175, 247].

* **Mathematical Identity:**
$$\mathcal{A}_{k}(t) \equiv \left| \frac{\dot{\omega}_{k}}{\omega_{k}^{2}} \right| \ll 1 \iff \left| \frac{\dot{c}_{s}}{c_{s}} \right| [cite_start]\ll H$$ [cite: 200]

### **String Theory Signatures in Cosmological Observables**
[Paper Link: IPRT/String-Cosmo-Bounds](cite: 301)
* [cite_start]This analysis filters effective field theories through the Swampland Program to identify falsifiable signatures of String Theory in multi-messenger cosmology[cite: 307, 351].
* [cite_start]By applying the Strong Swampland Distance Conjecture ($\lambda\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$), the paper derives a bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r < 10^{-3}$[cite: 310, 364].
* [cite_start]It identifies a "sweet spot" for metastable cosmic superstrings with tension $G\mu \sim 10^{-11}$ and reconnection probability $P \in [10^{-3}, 10^{-1}]$ to resolve NANOGrav spectral tensions[cite: 312, 373].
* [cite_start]The work predicts post-merger "echoes" from black hole fuzzballs and "forbidden zones" in the mass-spin plane due to the String Axiverse[cite: 399, 403].

### **JWST Cosmic-Dawn Tensions and a Dark-Star Pathway**
[Paper Link: IPRT/JWST-Dark-Stars](cite: 445)
* [cite_start]This work proposes the **Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS)** hypothesis to explain anomalous high-redshift observations by the James Webb Space Telescope[cite: 452].
* [cite_start]SMDSs resolve tensions regarding "little red dots" and extremely luminous galaxies (e.g., JADES-GS-z14-0) by providing a "heavy-seed" route for rapid black-hole growth[cite: 450, 505].
* [cite_start]These baryonic objects are powered by dark-matter annihilation (WIMPs) rather than nuclear fusion, allowing them to reach masses up to $10^{7} M_{\odot}$[cite: 453, 467].
* [cite_start]A critical diagnostic is the predicted **He II $\lambda 1640$ absorption trough**, which distinguishes SMDSs from ordinary Population III stars[cite: 454, 484].

* **Mathematical Identity:**
[cite_start]$$q_{ann} = f_{Q}\langle\sigma v\rangle\frac{\rho_{\chi}^{2}}{m_{\chi}}$$ [cite: 475]

### **The Transduction Bound: An Integrated Information-Thermodynamic Theorem**
[Paper Link: IPRT/Transduction-Bound](cite: 543)
* [cite_start]This paper establishes a unified law for thermodynamic transduction in thermally open NPT Markov jump processes[cite: 547, 561].
* [cite_start]It provides an exact mean work decomposition into reversible equilibrium change, stored nonequilibrium structure (KL divergence), and irreversible dissipation[cite: 550, 562].
* [cite_start]The work incorporates the Shiraishi-Funo-Saito (SFS) speed-dissipation constraint as a finite-time efficiency ceiling[cite: 551, 669].
* [cite_start]An information-geometric Pythagorean decomposition is applied relative to physical constraint manifolds[cite: 552, 659].

* **Mathematical Identity:**
[cite_start]$$\langle W \rangle = \Delta G_{eq} + k_{B}T D_{KL}(p_{\tau} \| \pi_{\tau}) + k_{B}T \langle \Sigma \rangle$$ [cite: 647]
