Current Research & Publications (2026)Stopping-Time Universality in Signaling-Safe Objective Collapse[Paper Link: IPRT/Collapse-Universality](cite: 1)This paper proves a classification theorem for objective-collapse theories, demonstrating that signaling-safe "physical collapse" is isomorphic to information updating within a consistent instrument framework1.Any model that is sharp in single runs and signaling-safe in ensembles is mathematically equivalent to conditioning on a quantum instrument2222.+1When collapse is triggered by a threshold in a record-adapted sharpness statistic, collapse-time laws are restricted to first-passage families3333.+1In the canonical drift-diffusion limit, the collapse-time statistics follow the Inverse-Gaussian (Wald) distribution4444.+1Mathematical Identity:$$f_{\tau}(t) = \frac{y_{*}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi t^{3}}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y_{*} - \nu t)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}t}\right)$$5Algebraic Consistency of Relativistic Field Theories[Paper Link: IPRT/Relativistic-Field-CST](cite: 167)This research extends the Causality-Stability Tester (CST) framework to FLRW spacetime, providing a dynamical diagnostic for early-Universe field theories6666.+2It introduces Gate G7 (Adiabatic Stability), which ensures that time-dependent frequencies vary slowly enough to prevent explosive particle creation7777.+1An exact Horndeski/DHOST inflationary attractor is constructed that satisfies all consistency gates, including ghost-freedom and hyperbolicity8888.+1The model derives tensor speed corrections constrained by LIGO/Virgo observations9999.+1Mathematical Identity:$$\mathcal{A}_{k}(t) \equiv \left| \frac{\dot{\omega}_{k}}{\omega_{k}^{2}} \right| \ll 1 \iff \left| \frac{\dot{c}_{s}}{c_{s}} \right| \ll H$$10String Theory Signatures in Cosmological Observables[Paper Link: IPRT/String-Cosmo-Bounds](cite: 301)This analysis filters effective field theories through the Swampland Program to identify falsifiable signatures of String Theory in multi-messenger cosmology11111111.+1By applying the Strong Swampland Distance Conjecture, the paper derives a bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r < 10^{-3}$12121212.+1It identifies a "sweet spot" for metastable cosmic superstrings with tension $G\mu \sim 10^{-11}$ and reconnection probability $P \in [10^{-3}, 10^{-1}]$13131313.+1The work predicts post-merger "echoes" from black hole fuzzballs detectable by the Einstein Telescope14.JWST Cosmic-Dawn Tensions and a Dark-Star Pathway[Paper Link: IPRT/JWST-Dark-Stars](cite: 445)This work proposes the Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) hypothesis to explain anomalous high-redshift observations by the James Webb Space Telescope15151515.+2SMDSs resolve tensions regarding "little red dots" and extremely luminous galaxies by providing a "heavy-seed" route for rapid black-hole growth16161616.+1These baryonic objects are powered by dark-matter annihilation (WIMPs) rather than nuclear fusion17171717.+1A critical diagnostic is the predicted He II $\lambda 1640$ absorption trough, which distinguishes SMDSs from ordinary Population III stars18181818.+1Mathematical Identity:$$q_{ann} = f_{Q}\langle\sigma v\rangle\frac{\rho_{\chi}^{2}}{m_{\chi}}$$19The Transduction Bound: An Integrated Information-Thermodynamic Theorem[Paper Link: IPRT/Transduction-Bound](cite: 543)This paper establishes a unified law for thermodynamic transduction in thermally open NPT Markov jump processes20202020.+1It provides an exact mean work decomposition into reversible equilibrium change, stored nonequilibrium structure (KL divergence), and irreversible dissipation21212121.+1The work incorporates the Shiraishi-Funo-Saito (SFS) speed-dissipation constraint as a finite-time efficiency ceiling22222222.+1An information-geometric Pythagorean decomposition is applied relative to physical constraint manifolds23232323.+1Mathematical Identity:$$\langle W \rangle = \Delta G_{eq} + k_{B}T D_{KL}(p_{\tau} \| \pi_{\tau}) + k_{B}T \langle \Sigma \rangle$$
